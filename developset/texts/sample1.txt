   GUATEMALA CITY, 19 MAY 90 (DPA) -- [TEXT] THE BUS STRIKE IN
GUATEMALA CITY CONTINUED FOR THE FOURTH DAY TODAY.  LAST NIGHT, THERE
WERE NEW DISTURBANCES AND TERRORIST BOMBS WERE SET OFF.

   ALTHOUGH THE SITUATION HAS CAUSED GREAT DISCONTENT AMONG THE 1.2
MILLION PEOPLE OF THE CAPITAL, THE GOVERNMENT HAS FOR THE TIME BEING
REJECTED THE MUNICIPALITY'S REQUEST TO PLACE THE BUS SERVICES UNDER
MILITARY CONTROL.

   THE BUS OWNERS ARE ASKING FOR A 100-PERCENT INCREASE IN THE 20
CENTAVO ($.05) FARE, ARGUING THAT INFLATION HAS INCREASED THE PRICE OF
GASOLINE AND THE BUS MAINTENANCE COSTS.  HOWEVER, THE MUNICIPALITY HAS
NOT AUTHORIZED THE INCREASE, FEARING A GENERALIZED PROTEST BY BUS
PASSENGERS.

   HAVANA (CUBA), 18 MAY 90 (INTERNATIONAL SERVICE) -- [COMMENTARY]
[TEXT] NINE YEARS AGO TODAY, THEN ECUADORAN PRESIDENT JAIME ROLDOS
AGUILERA DIED WHEN HIS PLANE CRASHED WHILE ON A FLIGHT TO THE INTERIOR
OF HIS COUNTRY. THE SMALL PLANE SUFFERED THE ACCIDENT WHILE FLYING THE
PRESIDENT, HIS WIFE, AND A DELEGATION THAT INCLUDED HIGH- RANKING ARMY
OFFICERS FROM QUITO TO LOJA PROVINCE.  ALL OF THEM DIED.  THE
RELATIVES OF THE LATE PRESIDENT EXPRESSED DOUBTS THAT THE PLANE
CRASHED ACCIDENTALLY AND FILED CHARGES AS PRIVATE CITIZENS, BUT THE
CASE WAS LATER CLOSED.

   DOUBTS HAVE BEEN EXPRESSED SEVERAL TIMES ABOUT THE ALLEGED
ACCIDENT, AND THE CASE RESURFACED AGAIN WHEN A NEW INVESTIGATION WAS
OPENED AND ONE OF THE WITNESSES DISCLOSED THAT THERE IS EVIDENCE OF
PARTICIPATION BY THE U.S. CIA IN THE DEATH OF ROLDOS AND HIS RETINUE.
ERNESTO BUENANO, ROLDOS' POLITICAL ADVISER, ASSERTED BEFORE A
MULTIPARTY COMMISSION OF THE ECUADORAN CONGRESS THAT THE PLANE
ACCIDENT IN WHICH THE FORMER PRESIDENT DIED DID NOT RESULT FROM HUMAN
ERROR OR TECHNICAL FAILURE BUT FROM SABOTAGE, WHICH CONSISTED OF
CONTAMINATING THE PLANE'S FUEL TO CAUSE ITS ENGINES TO STALL.  THE
WITNESS POINTED OUT THAT THERE IS INCONTESTABLE EVIDENCE ABOUT THIS
AND URGED THE COMMISSION TO INVESTIGATE THE PERSONS WHO WERE
RESPONSIBLE FOR SUPPLYING FUEL TO THE PRESIDENT'S PLANE.

   IT IS WORTH MENTIONING THAT ROLDOS' ADMINISTRATION WAS
CHARACTERIZED BY A PROGRESSIVE ORIENTATION, AND MORE SPECIFICALLY BY
HIS DIRECT OPPOSITION TO U.S. ATTEMPTS TO DOMINATE THE LATIN AMERICAN
COUNTRIES.  THE FORMER PRESIDENT WAS OPENLY IN SOLIDARITY WITH THE
SANDINIST NATIONAL LIBERATION FRONT OF NICARAGUA AND THE SALVADORAN
INSURGENTS.  HIS ADOPTION OF THIS STANCE LED U.S.  IMPERIALISM TO
CONSIDER THE ROLDOS DOCTRINE AS A DANGER TO ITS INTERESTS.

   WHEN ONE RECALLS THE POSITION OF THE FORMER ECUADORAN PRESIDENT,
THE DISAPPEARANCE OF FORMER PANAMANIAN LEADER OMAR TORRIJOS HERRERA
ALSO COMES TO MIND.  TORRIJOS' DEATH WAS SIMILAR IN CIRCUMSTANCES TO
THAT OF JAIME ROLDOS, AND HIS PATRIOTIC ATTITUDE WITH REGARD TO HIS
COUNTRY'S SOVEREIGNTY WAS ALSO SIMILAR.  TORRIJOS AND ROLDOS WERE A
NUISANCE TO U.S. PLANS IN LATIN AMERICA AND BOTH WERE MURDERED, AS
VARIOUS SOURCES HAVE DISCLOSED.  FORMER CHILEAN PRESIDENT SALVADOR
ALLENDE [WORDS INDISTINCT] IT CANNOT BE SAID THAT THE CIA'S HAND
DIRECTLY TOOK HIS LIFE, THE ORGANIZATION DID HELP DESTABILIZE HIS
PROGRESSIVE GOVERNMENT.

   THE INVESTIGATIONS ON JAIME ROLDOS' DEATH AND WHAT WAS SAID AT THE
TIME ABOUT THE ALLEGED ACCIDENT SUFFERED BY OMAR TORRIJOS REVEAL ONCE
MORE THE SINISTER PLANS OF THE U.S. CIA AGAINST OUR LATIN AMERICAN AND
CARIBBEAN PEOPLE, WHO MUST REMAIN ON THE ALERT.

   SAN SALVADOR, 21 MAY 90 (ACAN - EFE) -- [TEXT] A MILITARY SPOKESMAN
HAS REPORTED THAT ONE CIVILIAN WAS KILLED AND FIVE OTHER PEOPLE,
INCLUDING A POLICEMAN, WERE INJURED TODAY AS A RESULT OF THE EXPLOSION
OF A GRENADE THROWN AT A POLICE PATROL CAR BY ALLEGED URBAN GUERRILLA
COMMANDOS.

   THE CIVILIAN WHO WAS KILLED HAS BEEN IDENTIFIED AS JOSE OVIDIO
GOMEZ, A TAXI DRIVER, AND THE INJURED POLICEMAN IS RICARDO ANTONIO
MARTINEZ.  MARTINEZ AND THE OTHER PERSONS WHO WERE INJURED, SOME
SERIOUSLY, WERE TAKEN TO A SAN SALVADOR MEDICAL CENTER.

   ACCORDING TO THE SOURCE, THE GRENADE WAS THROWN AT 0630 (1230 GMT)
TODAY.  THE ATTACK TOOK PLACE NEAR THE CENTRAL MARKETPLACE, SAN
SALVADOR'S MOST IMPORTANT SUPPLY CENTER, WHICH IS VERY CROWDED AT THAT
TIME OF DAY.

   THE SOURCE ATTRIBUTED THE ATTACK TO URBAN GUERRILLA COMMANDOS, BUT
THE GUERRILLAS HAVE NOT CLAIMED CREDIT FOR IT.

   THIS IS THE FIRST ATTACK THAT HAS TAKEN PLACE IN THE SALVADORAN
CAPITAL SINCE THE PEACE NEGOTIATIONS BETWEEN THE GOVERNMENT AND THE
FARABUNDO MARTI NATIONAL LIBERATION FRONT BEGAN LAST WEDNESDAY IN
VENEZUELA.

   THE TALKS ARE IN THEIR SIXTH DAY TODAY AND THERE IS AN ATMOSPHERE
OF OPTIMISM.  ACCORDING TO SOURCES CLOSE TO THE DIALOGUE, IMPORTANT
PROGRESS HAS BEEN MADE TO SECURE THE PACIFICATION OF EL SALVADOR,
WHICH FOR A DECADE HAS BEEN ENDURING A CIVIL WAR IN WHICH MORE THAN
70,000 PEOPLE HAVE DIED.

   BOGOTA, 21 MAY 90 (INRAVISION TELEVISION CADENA 1) -- [SPEECH]
[PRESIDENT VIRGILIO BARCO] [TEXT] FELLOW COUNTRYMEN: I ADDRESS YOU AT
A MOMENT WHEN ALL GOOD COLOMBIANS ARE FILLED WITH PAIN.  TERRORIST
ACTIONS HAVE BROUGHT SADNESS AND MOURNING TO DOZENS OF OUR POOR HOMES,
AS WELL AS TO FAMILIES OF NATIONAL LEADERS.  COLOMBIA'S ENEMIES HAVE
DEDICATED THEMSELVES TO ATTACKING UNARMED CITIZENS.  THEIR INSANE
ACTIONS ARE ENDING THE LIVES OF INNOCENT CHILDREN, WOMEN, AND HONEST
COLOMBIANS.  AT THESE TRYING TIMES, I SEND ALL THOSE WHO HAVE SUFFERED
THE CONSEQUENCES OF THIS IRRATIONAL WAVE OF MONSTROUS CRIMES MY
DEEPEST SENTIMENTS OF SOLIDARITY.  I WANT TO TELL ALL THE VICTIMS'
RELATIVES AND FRIENDS THAT WE SHARE THEIR SORROW AND SADNESS.

   THE COUNTRY AND ANTIOQUIA DEPARTMENT HAVE BEEN DEALT A STRONG BLOW
TODAY.  ANOTHER GREAT MAN HAS BEEN ASSASSINATED.  LIBERAL LEADER
FEDERICO ESTRADA VELEZ WAS VIOLENTLY MURDERED IN THE STREETS OF
MEDELLIN.  THE LOSS OF SENATOR ESTRADA VELEZ LEAVES THE LIBERAL PARTY
AND ANTIOQUIANS WITHOUT ONE OF ITS GREAT LEADERS.  HE IS TO BE ADDED
TO THE LIST OF MARTYRS THAT HAVE BEEN MURDERED FOR THEIR THOUGHTS AND
BRAVE ATTITUDE IN CONFRONTING THE COUNTRY'S PROBLEMS.  FEDERICO
ESTRADA WAS A FIGHTER IN THIS ADMINISTARTION AND, AS OUR COLOMBIAN
AMBASSADOR TO ITALY, CONTRIBUTED TO THE IMPROVEMENT OF RELATIONS WITH
THAT COUNTRY AND WITH THE EUROPEAN COMMUNITY.  THE COUNTRY RECALLS HIM
FOR HIS RECENT ACTIONS AS THE PROPONENT AND PROMOTER OF THE
CONSTITUTIONAL REFORMS PROJECT AT THE SENATE.  HIS BRILLANT POLITICAL
AND PROFESSIONAL CAREER ALLOWED HIM TO REACH THE HIGHEST POSITIONS OF
THE COLOMBIAN CONGRESS AND OF THE JUDICIAL BRANCH.  HE WAS A SUPREME
COURT MAGISTRATE, UNIVERSITY PROFESSOR, PARLIAMENTARIAN, THE NATIONAL
AND DEPARTMENTAL LEADER OF THE LIBERAL PARTY, A PUBLIC SERVANT OF MANY
YEARS, AND A TIRELESS WORKER FOR THE WELLBEING OF THE PEOPLE OF
ANTIOQUA.  HIS LIFE WAS ENDED AT A TIME WHEN THE COUNTRY AND HIS PARTY
NEEDED HIS EXPERIENCE AND KNOWLEDGE.

   TO HIS WIFE, HIS FOUR CHILDREN, HIS FOLLOWERS, AND ALL ANTIOQUEANS,
I SEND A HEARTFELT MESSAGE OF CONDOLENCE IN THE NAME OF ALL HIS FELLOW
COUNTRYMEN.  THE PEOPLE ARE SICK OF THIS IRRATIONAL VIOLENCE.  ALL
COLOMBIANS GET ANGRY EACH TIME A BARBARIC ACT TAKES PLACE AND EACH
TIME ONE OF OUR LEADERS IS MURDERED.  LET US TURN THIS ANGER INTO A
PUBLIC CONDEMNATION OF THOSE RESPONSIBLE FOR THESE ACTIONS, IN A
DECIDED ACTION BY ALL AGAINST THE EMPIRE OF CRIME, AND IN EFFECTIVE
SOLIDARITY WITH GOVERNMENT OFFICIALS.  RECOVERING PEACE AND
TRANQUILLITY IS A JOINT TASK.  EVERY DAY WE MUST DEMAND MORE
EFFICIENCY FROM OUR PUBLIC FORCES BUT WE MUST ALSO GIVE THEM MORE
SOLIDARITY AND SUPPORT SO THAT THEY CAN EFFICIENTLY COMPLY WITH THEIR
SERIOUS RESPONSIBILITIES.  THIS IS WHAT THE GOVERNMENT HAS BEEN DOING;
IT HAS SUPPORTED THEM MORALLY AND MATERIALLY.

   TO DEFEAT TERRORISM AND IMPUNITY DEPENDS ABOVE ALL ON THE
COOPERATION OF CITIZENS.  WE MUST ALL BECOME LIKE SOLDIERS IN THE
SEARCH FOR PEACE BECAUSE THE FUTURE OF OUR FAMILIES, OUR PRINCIPLES,
OUR RIGHTS, AND OUR DEMOCRACY ARE AT STAKE.  LET THOSE WHO PROMOTE
VIOLENCE FACE AN INVINCIBLE ARMY OF 30 MILLION HONEST COLOMBIANS.  NO
ONE SHOULD TAKE ADVANTAGE OF THIS PAINFUL MOMENT THE COUNTRY IS
ENDURING.  THE INTERESTS OF COLOMBIA ARE ABOVE ALL OTHER
CONSIDERATIONS.

   ON THE EVE OF THE ELECTIONS AND THE DECISION BY THE HONORABLE
SUPREME COURT OF JUSTICE ON THE CONSTITUTIONAL ASSEMBLY, AND AFTER A
THOROUGH ANALYSIS OF THE MOST RECENT PUBLIC ORDER DISTURBANCES, I HAVE
DEEMED IT APPROPRIATE TO SEND THE FOREIGN MINISTER TO REPRESENT
COLOMBIA AT THE ANDEAN GROUP PRESIDENTIAL SUMMIT.

   AS YOU ARE AWARE, THE ANDEAN GROUP PRESIDENTIAL SUMMIT WILL BEGIN
TOMORROW IN CUZCO, PERU.  THIS MEETING WAS CALLED WITH THE OBJECTIVE
OF ACHIEVING NEW PROGRESS IN THE INTEGRATION OF THE SUBREGION, THROUGH
NEW MECHANISMS FOR INTEGRATION AND WITH THE CREATION OF THE ANDEAN
PRESIDENTIAL COUNCIL.

   THE FOREIGN MINISTER WILL BE ENTRUSTED WITH REAFFIRMING COLOMBIA'S
FULL COMMITMENT TO THE INTEGRATION PROCESS AND TO CONCERTED NEW JOINT
ACTIONS WITH PERU, ECUADOR, BOLIVIA, AND VENEZUELA TO FACE THE PROBLEM
OF THE CONSUMPTION, SMUGGLING, AND DRUG PRODUCTION.

   FELLOW COUNTRYMEN: I HEREBY REITERATE MY DEEPEST CONDOLENCES TO ALL
THOSE WHO HAVE BEEN AFFECTED BY VIOLENCE.  IT IS AT THIS TIME OF
SORROW AND SADNESS WHEN WE COLOMBIANS SHOULD BE MORE UNITED THAN EVER.
I WANT TO INVITE YOU TO USE THE SUFFERING AND THE MEMORIES OF THOSE
WHO HAVE FALLEN AS A FORCE THAT WILL GIVE US MORE COURAGE AND
DETERMINATION TO CONTINUE TO PROGRESS IN BUILDING COLOMBIA IN PEACE,
FREE OF TERRORISM AND VIOLENCE.  GOOD NIGHT.

   QUITO, 21 MAY 90 (RADIO QUITO) -- [REPORT] [ALVARO GOMEZ] [TEXT]
ALL MEDIA IN GUAYAQUIL AND MANY CORRESPONDENTS WHO HAVE COME TO THE
PORT OF GUAYAQUIL TO COVER THE FOURTH ALFARO LIVES DAMMIT [AVC]
NATIONAL CONFERENCE ARE STILL UNAWARE OF WHERE THE MEETING IS BEING
HELD.  THE SURRENDERING OF WEAPONS IN THE HANDS OF THIS GROUP WILL BE
DISCUSSED AT THIS MEETING.  THE FOUR-DAY MEETING BEGAN ON 18 MAY AT
THE GUAYAS ELECTORAL TRIBUNAL.  HOWEVER, THE MEETING WAS CONTINUED
LATER AT AN UNDISCLOSED LOCATION IN GUAYAQUIL.  DURING THEIR SESSIONS,
IN ADDITION TO MAKING A DECISION ON THE SURRENDERING OF WEAPONS, AVC
LEADERS WILL ALSO ASSESS THE AGREEMENT THEY SIGNED A YEAR AGO WITH THE
PRESIDENT RODRIGO BORJA GOVERNMENT.  THE ACCORD MADE IT POSSIBLE FOR
THEM TO CEASE THE ARMED STRUGGLE IN EXCHANGE FOR A GOVERNMENT DIALOGUE
WITH SOCIAL SECTORS IN THE COUNTRY.  PRIOR TO THE BEGINNING OF THE
FOURTH AVC NATIONAL CONFERENCE, AVC LEADER SANTIAGO DILLMAN REPORTED
ON 18 MAY THAT THE FINAL DECISION ON THE SURRENDERING OF WEAPONS WAS A
LOGICAL STEP -- AFTER TAKING INTO CONSIDERATION THAT THE ARMED
STRUGGLE IN ECUADOR AND IN THE REST OF LATIN AMERICA IS NO LONGER THE
PROPER COURSE.  THEREFORE, HE ANNOUNCED, THIS ALFARIST MEETING WILL
ALSO ANALYZE THE DECISION TO ORGANIZE A NEW POLITICAL PARTY OR TO
ALLOW AVC LEADERS TO JOIN AN ALREADY EXISTING GROUP RECOGNIZED BY THE
SUPREME ELECTORAL TRIBUNAL.

   THESE ARE SOME OF THE POINTS ON THE AGENDA OF THE AVC MEETING,
WHICH IS EXPECTED TO CONCLUDE ON 21 OR 22 MAY WITH A HISTORICAL
RESOLUTION.  HOWEVER, AVC LEADERS -- AMONG THEM SANTIAGO DILLMAN,
MARCO TROYA, PEDRO MONCADA, AND JANETH SOSA -- HAVE PREFERRED NOT TO
DISCLOSE THE SITE OF THE MEETING, WHICH HAS FRUSTRATED THE WORK OF
JOURNALISTS.  THE AVC LEADERS PLAN TO DISCUSS THE POSSIBILITY OF
DELIVERING WEAPONS IN THE HANDS OF AVC MEMBERS TO A SOCIALIST
INTERNATIONAL DELEGATION IN A CEREMONY SIMILAR TO ONE RECENTLY HELD BY
THE 19-APRIL MOVEMENT IN COLOMBIA, WHICH IN THE PAST HAS STAGED
SEVERAL WELL-KNOWN MILITARY ACTIONS, INCLUDING THE KIDNAPPING OF
BUSINESSMAN NAIM ISAIAS WITH THE HELP OF THE AVC.

   THE AVC HAS SAID IT WANTS TO PARTICIPATE IN THE COUNTRY'S
INSTITUTIONAL LIFE.  IN ORDER TO DO THIS, IT WILL PLEDGE TO SURRENDER
ITS WEAPONS -- THE SYMBOL OF ITS REBELLION -- WHICH IT WILL CONTINUE
WITH OR WITHOUT WEAPONS, AVC LEADERS HAVE SAID.  THE AVC LEADERS
CONTINUE MEETING AT AN UNKNOWN LOCATION IN GUAYAQUIL AND EXPECT TO
REACH AN AGREEMENT SOON ON LAYING DOWN THEIR WEAPONS, WHICH WOULD THEN
BE DESTROYED IMMEDIATELY.
